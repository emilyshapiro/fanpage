                <p> Are You the One?, sometimes abbreviated as AYTO?, is an American reality television series on MTV, in which young singles try to find love. A group of men and women are secretly paired into male-female couples by producers, via a matchmaking algorithm. Then, while living together, the contestants try to identify all of these "perfect matches." If they succeed, the entire group shares a prize of up to $1 million. Over the course of each season, the contestants have the opportunity to pair up in different combinations to compete against each other to win dates, as well as the opportunity to learn in the "truth booth" if a given couple is a correct match. At the end of each episode, the contestants pair up in a "matching ceremony" and learn how many perfect matches they have, but not which matches are correct.[1] From season 3 onward, the prize was reduced any time that the house failed to identify any matches other than those already confirmed via the truth booth.</p>
